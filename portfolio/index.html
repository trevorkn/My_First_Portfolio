                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a deep interest in how language and technology shape the world. I started with a love for words and communication â€” now I'm learning to build digital experiences through code. Every day, I push myself to grow â€” writing, coding, asking better questions, and learning by doing.

I work from Linux, live in VS Code, and document my journey on GitHub and through daily blogs. Iâ€™m focused on building strong foundations, both in tech and in myself. I believe in staying consistent, staying curious, and creating things that speak â€” whether through words or code.

               <p>PaidLancer is a web-based freelance platform I built to combine practical front-end development skills with a real-world concept.
